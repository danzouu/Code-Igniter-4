Anchor tag:

I used a style tag inside an anchor because styling an anchor through css is not working for me. 

I tried using:

.a{}
.a:link, a:visited{} And still the anchor was still not applying/changing for me.

Info page:

I tried finishing the info page but due to lack of time, I did not get to finish it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Styling:

I did not use the provided css and bootstrap because I had problems linking them with the pages before. So I made my own style.css(only) and I only used simple card and header design which I should have done using bootstrap but I didn't.

Database:

I made/chose this database since it was pretty easy for me to continously add column values without looking up on the internet.
